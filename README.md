## DESCRIPTION

This is my first NFT collection project. I've created a collection of Cool Dogs and deployed it to Polygon mainnet.
There's also a simple [web app](https://www.netlify.com/) that mints the NFT collection.

### Steps

- Created the image layers using [VistaCreate](https://create.vista.com/es/home/)
- Images created using Base art generator code from [hashlips_art_engine](https://github.com/HashLips/hashlips_art_engine)
- Hosted the metadata on [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/)
- Most of the NFT infrastructure uses [NFTPort](https://nftport.xyz)
- Web app deployed on [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
